# MachineLearning_Lentil_Seed_Coat_Colour_and_Phenolics
# Found the best model to predict seed coat colours of lentil seeds based on the types of phenolics
# Dataset: 190 lentil genotypes with 91 features (phenolic compounds) and seed coat color as label (47 brown, 47 grey, 48 green, 48 tan) 
# Machine learning models: K-nearest neighbor, Random Forest, and Support vector machines 
# SVM with 78 % accuracy performed the best.
